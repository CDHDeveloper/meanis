{"name":"Meanis","tagline":"MEANIS (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node, I18next, Socket.io) stack Boilerplate","body":"# MEANIS Stack\r\n\r\nMEANIS is a fork of [MEAN](https://github.com/linnovate/mean). MEANIS is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for MongoDB, Node.js, Express, AngularJS, I18next and Socket.io based applications.\r\nIt is designed to give you quick and organized way to start developing of MEANIS based web apps with useful modules like mongoose and passport pre-bundled and configured.\r\nWe mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/).\r\n* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - Make sure it's running on the default port(27017).\r\n\r\n## Additional Packages\r\n* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* I18next - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* Socket.io - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.\r\n* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.\r\n* UI Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nSee the [config](config/) folder and especially the [config.js](config/config.js) file.\r\n\r\n## Quick Install\r\n\r\n The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:\r\n\r\n Install npm (server side) dependencies:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install\r\n\r\n Install bower (client side) dependencies:\r\n\r\n    $ bower install\r\n\r\n Start the server:\r\n\r\n    $ node server\r\n\r\n Then open a browser and go to:\r\n\r\n    http://localhost:3000\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n  We pre-included an article example, check it out:\r\n  * [The Model](app/models/article.js) - Where we define our object schema.\r\n  * [The Controller](app/controllers/articles.js) - Where we take care of our backend logic.\r\n  * [NodeJS Routes](config/routes.js) - Where we define our REST service routes.\r\n  * [AngularJs Routes](public/js/config.js) - Where we define our CRUD routes.\r\n  * [The AngularJs Service](public/js/services/articles.js) - Where we connect to our REST service.\r\n  * [The I18next Service](public/js/services/i18next.js) - Where we connect to our I18next service.\r\n  * [The Socket.io Service](public/js/services/socket.io.js) - Where we connect to our Socket.io service.\r\n  * [The AngularJs Controller](public/js/controllers/articles.js) - Where we take care of  our frontend logic.\r\n  * [The AngularJs Views Folder](public/views/articles) - Where we keep our CRUD views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## MEAN Modules\r\n   Mean presents a growing eco-system of MEAN based modules in the npm repository, To write (and contribute) your own MEAN based module checkout [mean-logger](https://npmjs.org/package/mean-logger) for examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n## More Information\r\n\r\n  * Visit our [Ninja's Zone](http://www.meanleanstartupmachine.com/) for extended support.\r\n  * Visit us at [Linnovate.net](http://www.linnovate.net/).\r\n  * Visit us at [Chris.enytc.com](http://chris.enytc.com/).\r\n  * Contact amos on any issue via [E-Mail](mailto:chris.enytc@gmail.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/chrisenytc), or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/chrisenytc).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
